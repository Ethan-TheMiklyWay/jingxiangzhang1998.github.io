### Introduction
<!-- outline-start -->This project is VR 3D roaming with Unity 3D engine.<!-- outline-end --> The process of designing VR project is just like design a game, which include design roaming scene, events trigger, models, and so on. The difficulty of the project is not in the programming itself, but the complexity of Unity, the logic of the game, and the design of scenes and models.

For example, this is the map of the roaming scene.
