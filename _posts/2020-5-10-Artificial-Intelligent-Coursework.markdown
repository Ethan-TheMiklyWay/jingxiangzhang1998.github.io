### Introduction

These projects were the programmed in Artificial Intelligent course in my undergraduate years. I took AI course for two semester (AI Ⅰ and AI Ⅱ), and it include three parts, which are <!-- outline-start -->classical AI algorithm, machine learning, and deep learning<!-- outline-end -->. Here are some demonstration of my works.

### Artificial Intelligent

#### A* Search Algorithm

This project was programmed by C#.

#### ACO and PWO Algorithms

This is the final project of AI Ⅰ. Solve TSP problems by ant colony optimization algorithms and particle swarm algorithms optimization. It was programmed by Python.

### Machine Learning

All the machine learning algorithm below use flower dataset, and use petal width and height as two features.

#### Bayes Classification

#### K Means

#### SVM

### Deep Learning

In the deep learning part, I use paddlepaddle (like tensorflow or pytorch) as tool.

#### AlexNet and VGG

Dataset is flower. The picture below is part of the dataset after propressing.

And the result is:

#### Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)

This picture below is generated by GAN, using mnist handwritten digit dataset.

This picture below is generated by GAN, using fashion mnist clothes dataset.
